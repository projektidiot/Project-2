Princess Peach

	Grace of royalty, sensability of a plumber
She will clear out the pipes of bureaucracy with her sense justice.

Sonic the Hedgehog

	Running for freedom, running for all!
He'll never run from a good fight.

Calvin

	Throwing tantrums in the interest of the people
Don't be fooled by his appearance of innocence, he knows what to do with adversity.
